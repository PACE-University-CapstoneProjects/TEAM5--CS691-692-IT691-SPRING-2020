Abstract: Among the threats facing todayâ€™s critical infrastructures
such as power, water, telecommunication, and gas systems
industries are cyber-attacks. To protect and defend themselves
against cyber threats, these aforementioned infrastructures use
Industrial Control Systems. The main goal for these systems
is to improve efficiency and controllability while minimizing
human input. Malicious events caused by cyber-attacks are better
managed when they are detected early on. Hence, they require a
system with the ability to constantly monitor all operations and
the ability to accordingly respond to attacks. The combination of
Machine Learning and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
Systems can help build a protection/defense system by automating
the process of categorizing/classifying malicious events. By using
a data-driven approach, the detection of malicious events was
explored. The work demonstrated in the text that follows attempts
to show how the Industrial Control Systems framework combined
with the machine learning algorithm, Reduced Error Pruning
Tree, can be used to design a system that monitors and alerts
users to cyber-attacks. Following a brief overview of machine
learning, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems, and
Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge for Industrial
Control Systems Framework, this work presents a stepby
step analysis of attacks on a gas pipeline. The last part of this
work highlights the opportunities found in furthering research
for the automation of systems that keep critical infrastructures
secure.
